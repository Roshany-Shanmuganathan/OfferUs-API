# Project Requirement Document

## Problem Statement

**What specific problem are you trying to solve?**  
Currently, partners (brand-partners) struggle to reach members with their offers due to limited advertising options, while members miss out on local discounts because there’s no single platform to view all deals. This creates a gap between partners (brand-partners) and members in offering awareness and communication.

## Importance of Solving the Problem

**Why is this problem important to solve now?**  
This problem is important to solve now because digital partner (brand-partner)ping behavior is increasing, but local partners (brand-partners) still rely on outdated methods like posters or word-of-mouth. As a result, partners (brand-partners) lose potential sales, and members spend more time and money without finding the best deals. Solving this will boost local business visibility and improve member convenience through a modern, digital solution.

## Success Criteria

**What does success look like?**  
Success means partners (brand-partners) gain more members through the app and users easily find local offers.  
It’s successful when user engagement rises by **50%** and partner (brand-partner) sales increase by around **30%**.

## Planned Solution

1. The planned solution is a **Common Offers Marketing Platform** that connects partners (brand-partners) and members in one place.
2. Partners (Brand-Partners) can post their discounts, deals, and special offers easily through the app.
3. Members can browse nearby offers based on location and category, saving time and money.
4. The platform helps small businesses reach more people without high advertising costs.
5. It creates a win-win system where members find value and partners (brand-partners) grow their sales digitally.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP will include the basic features needed to connect partners (brand-partners) and members:

- Partner (Brand-Partner) registration and login
- Posting and managing offers (with expiry date)
- Member view of offers by location and category
- Basic search and filter options
- Simple analytics (views or clicks per offer)

## Users and Stakeholders

1. **Partners (Brand-Partners)**: Use this model as _Partner_ (use “Brand Partner” if needed).
2. **Members**: Use as _Member_ (they can join to receive customized offers).
